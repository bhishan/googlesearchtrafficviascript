# googlesearchtrafficviascript

I've created a python script to read a text file with keywords and initiate a proxy browser, make a google search for the keyword, find my website in the search results and finally clicking the link to my blog. Well that's how I earned almost 2000 unique visitors on a daily basis for various high paying keywords. I have removed the codes to further click on google ads. 
I had used koding.com to run my codes for getting wild search traffic to my blog. It was doing pretty well before I suffered a ban from using my koding VM until 2020 Oct (5 years). 

I used selenium with pyvirtual display on my koding vm to get the job done.
